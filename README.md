# Employee_Attrition_Prediction

Attrition is a problem that impacts all businesses, irrespective of geography, industry and size of the company. Employee attrition leads to significant costs for a business, including the cost of business disruption, hiring new staff and training new staff. As such, there is great business interest in understanding the drivers of, and minimizing staff attrition. Let us therefore turn to our predictive modelling capabilities and see if we can predict employee attrition on this dataset.

This notebook is structured as follows:

Exploratory Data Analysis: In this section, we explore the dataset by taking a look at the feature distributions, how correlated one feature is to the other and create some Seaborn and Plotly visualisations

Implementing Machine Learning models: We implement a Logestic regression, Decision tree  and a Random forest Model after which we look at feature importances from these respective models
